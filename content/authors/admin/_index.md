The **Forest Change Analysis Lab** (FOCAL) (*website coming soon!*) is led by Derek Young, a faculty member of the [Graduate Group in Ecology](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) and a Research Ecologist in the [Department of Plant Sciences](https://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis.

We work at the intersection of **forest disturbance ecology** and **data science**. We collect and analyze data to inform forest management in an era of climate change, drought, and large high-severity wildfires. We rely as much on **large geospatial datasets** as on **field-based measurements** of forests. We work closely with forest managers in an effort to address pressing forest management needs.

Questions that drive our work include:

* How will changes in climate and fire behavior interact to affect the natural capacity of forests to recover from disturbance?
* After high-severity wildfire, where should managers focus on planting tree seedlings---and what exactly should they plant---to most efficiently restore resilient forests?
